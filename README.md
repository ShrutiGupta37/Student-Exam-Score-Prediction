# ðŸŽ“Student-Exam-Score-Prediction

This project aims to **predict students' exam scores** using machine learning regression techniques based on various academic and lifestyle features. By analyzing factors like study hours, attendance, mental health, and previous performance, this tool offers valuable insights to educators for identifying students who might benefit from extra support.

## ðŸ’¡Project Objective

To develop a regression model that estimates a student's **exam score** using features such as:

- Hours Studied per Day
- Previous Exam Scores *(optional)*
- Attendance Percentage
- Mental Health Rating
- Sleep Hours per Night
- Part-Time Job Status

This model can help:
- Predict a student's exam performance
- Understand key factors affecting academic outcomes
- Support early intervention by educators

## Problem Statement

Academic performance is influenced by a variety of behavioral, psychological, and situational factors. Predicting exam scores can:
- Provide **personalized academic insights**
- Enable **targeted support** for underperforming students
- Guide students in **optimizing study habits and well-being**
